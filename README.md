# Channel-Discretization

This repository provides code for discretizing binomial channels, based on the method described in:

"On numerical methods of calculating the capacity of continuous-input discrete-output memoryless channels"
by Chain-I Chang, Simon C Fan, and Lee D Davisson, Information and Computation, 1990

This implementation supports evaluation and benchmarking in the context of:

by Adir Kobovich, Eitan Yaakobi and Nir Weinberger, ISIT, 2025

The full DeepDIVE project is available at adirk0/DeepDIVE

The Blahut-Arimoto algorithm implementation is adapted from kobybibas/blahut_arimoto_algorithm
